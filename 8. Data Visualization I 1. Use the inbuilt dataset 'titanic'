The provided Jupyter Notebook (`8.ipynb`) contains Python code that performs data analysis on the Titanic dataset using the `seaborn` library. Below is a summary of the code and its output, addressing the key components:

### Code Summary

1. **Imports**:
   - The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   ```

2. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The Titanic dataset is loaded using `sns.load_dataset('titanic')`.
   - The `dataset.head()` command displays the first five rows of the dataset, which includes columns such as:
     - `survived`: 0 (did not survive) or 1 (survived)
     - `pclass`: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3)
     - `sex`: Male or female
     - `age`: Age of the passenger
     - `sibsp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
     - `parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
     - `fare`: Ticket fare
     - `embarked`: Port of embarkation (C, Q, S)
     - `class`: Passenger class (First, Second, Third)
     - `who`: Man, woman, or child
     - `adult_male`: True or False
     - `deck`: Deck of the cabin
     - `embark_town`: Town of embarkation
     - `alive`: Yes or no
     - `alone`: True or False
   - Example output (first five rows):
     ```
       survived  pclass     sex   age  sibsp  parch     fare embarked  class    who  adult_male deck  embark_town alive  alone
     0         0       3    male  22.0      1      0   7.2500        S  Third    man        True  NaN  Southampton    no  False
     1         1       1  female  38.0      1      0  71.2833        C  First  woman       False    C    Cherbourg   yes  False
     2         1       3  female  26.0      0      0   7.9250        S  Third  woman       False  NaN  Southampton   yes   True
     3         1       1  female  35.0      1      0  53.1000        S  First  woman       False    C  Southampton   yes  False
     4         0       3    male  35.0      0      0   8.0500        S  Third    man        True  NaN  Southampton    no   True
     ```

3. **Visualization**:
   - The code creates a histogram of the `fare` column using `sns.histplot` (with a kernel density estimate, KDE).
   - The plot is customized with a figure size of 10x6, 30 bins, and a blue color.
   - The title is set to "Distribution of Ticket Fare," with "Fare" on the x-axis and "Frequency" on the y-axis.
   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.histplot(dataset['fare'], kde=True, bins=30, color='blue')
   plt.title('Distribution of Ticket Fare')
   plt.xlabel('Fare')
   plt.ylabel('Frequency')
   plt.show()
   ```
   - **Note**: The original code used `sns.distplot`, which is deprecated, and a warning suggests using `sns.histplot` or `sns.displot`. The corrected code uses `sns.histplot` as shown above.
   - The output is a histogram showing the distribution of ticket fares, with a KDE curve overlaid. The plot indicates that most fares are clustered at lower values (below 100), with a long tail extending to higher fares.

### Key Observations
- The Titanic dataset contains a mix of numerical (e.g., `age`, `fare`) and categorical (e.g., `sex`, `embarked`) variables.
- The histogram of `fare` shows a right-skewed distribution, typical for monetary data, where most passengers paid lower fares, and a few paid significantly higher amounts (e.g., up to ~500).
- The KDE curve provides a smoothed estimate of the fare distribution, reinforcing the skewed pattern.

### Additional Notes
- The warning about `distplot` being deprecated is addressed by using `histplot`, which is the recommended function in newer versions of `seaborn` (v0.14.0 and above).
- The dataset includes missing values (e.g., `NaN` in the `deck` column), which may require handling for further analysis.
- The visualization is effective for understanding the fare distribution but could be enhanced with additional plots (e.g., boxplots, or fare vs. survival status) for deeper insights.

If you have specific questions about the code, dataset, or want further analysis (e.g., exploring other variables or creating additional visualizations), please let me know!
